# FetchBot
An autonomous robot that plays fetch with your dog.

The idea behind FetchBot stems mainly from our love of dogs and pets, and we wanted to create something to show that appreciation. When we first started brainstorming for the project, we encountered a similar toy called the iFetch, which shoots a ball out after a dog puts it into a funnel. From this, we aimed to make something more involved to make the experience more enjoyable for our pets. We also wanted to add features in which a pet owner has full control over the robot, and can monitor and play with their pet without necessarily being in the same room.

FetchBot will be able to:
- Shoot balls both autonomously and manually
- Collect balls autonomously using image recognition
- Allow owners to remotely watch and interact with their pet through an app
